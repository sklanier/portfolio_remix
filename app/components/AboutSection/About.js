                    I consider myself a Jack of many trades. 
                    I've held a number of different positions over the years, 
                    and Each one has helped shape me into a well-rounded developer 
                    with a unique & broad skillset.
                </p>
                <p className="heroSub">
                    More than making stunning web content and software applications, 
                    I enjoy working with people. I believe wholeheartedly that coding 
                    is a team sport. Nothing great can be done alone, 
                    and a healthy relationship with my teammates is a vital prerequisite 
                    for success.
